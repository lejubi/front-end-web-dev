Electronic Piggy Bank! (But now as a static webpage!)

Your little brother Timmy is back at it again with the electronic piggy banks. 
Now it is 2023 so Timmy doesn't want to run a Java program to enter in his money. Instead, he prefers a website!

Functions to consider using:

1. Get an HTML element using its id
    let htmlElement = document.getElementById("id");

2. Adding an event listener for click:
    htmlElement.addEventListener("click", function)

3. Getting the user's input text:
    [The name of your input variable].value

Some other helpful functions:
str.toLowerCase() //turns the string str into lowercase 
.toFixed(2) // rounds a number to 2 decimal places
